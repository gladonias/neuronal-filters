# Reconfigurable Synthetically Engineered Neuronal Filters
This repository contains an implementation of Neuronal Digital Logic Gates, and Logic Circuits acting as filters. If you use this code for your published research, we suggest that you cite [our papers](https://github.com/gladonias/neuronal-filters/blob/master/references.bib).

### Simulation Environment
This implementation is performed under the [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) Simulation Enviroment with the Python Programming Language. The models of neurons were downloaded from [The Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal](https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/welcome).

### How to run?
This code was compiled to run primarily on Ubuntu 16.04+ running Python 3+ and NEURON 7.5. [LogicGates.py](https://github.com/gladonias/neuronal-filters/blob/master/LogicGates.py) is the main file to call necessary NEURON resources and run simulations.
