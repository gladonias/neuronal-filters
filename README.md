# Reconfigurable Synthetically Engineered Neuronal Filters
This repository contains an implementation of Neuronal Digital Logic Gates, and Logic Circuits acting as filters. If you use this code (or part of it) for your published research, we suggest that you cite [our papers](https://github.com/gladonias/neuronal-filters/blob/master/references.bib).

### Simulation Environment
This implementation is performed under the [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) Simulation Enviroment with the Python Programming Language. The models of neurons were downloaded from [The Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal](https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/welcome).

### How to run?
This code was compiled to run primarily on Ubuntu 16.04+ running Python 3+ and NEURON 7.5. [LogicGates.py](https://github.com/gladonias/neuronal-filters/blob/master/LogicGates.py) is the main file to call necessary NEURON resources and run simulations.

### Disclaimer
Due to the elapsed period between article submission and creation of this repository, part of the code may contain modifications that may not be relevant to the simulation of neuronal logic gates or filters. I should keep improving and polishing the algorithm and its documentation as necessary. Apologies for any incovenience.
